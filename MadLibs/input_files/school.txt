Can this day get any longer? We've been at school for <Number>  
hours, and we're all struggling to keep our <Plurl-part-of-the-Body> 
open. We've sat through a lecture about <Plural-Noun> , taken 
a/an <Noun> quiz in <Topic> class, and watched a movie about
<Noun> rights. And don't even mention the <Adjective> 
food we had for lunch in (the) <place> . But thankfully it's 
almost time for the final <Noun> to ring. And once it does, we
can grab our <Noun> , walk out of the <Type-of-Building> 's front
doors, and head off to the <Plural-Noun> that we all love. It's not
that we don't <Verb> school and our <Adjective> teachers-- 
we do! But there's nothing better than leaving our <Plural-Noun> 
behind to go practice with the <Noun> , <Verb> a picture, or
bake a/an <Noun> . <Exclamation> -- that's the bell!
We <Verb> for after school!
