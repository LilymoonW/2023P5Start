Create File: To Do!
Can this day get any longer? We've been at school for 892 
hours, and we're all struggling to keep our fingers 
open. We've sat through a lecture about apples , taken 
a/an orange quiz in Healthy habits class, and watched a movie about 
burger rights. And don't even mention the simple 
food we had for lunch in (the) temple . But thankfully it's 
almost time for the final bottle to ring. And once it does, we 
can grab our shoes , walk out of the tower 's front 
doors, and head off to the mice that we all love. It's not 
that we don't running school and our curious teachers-- 
we do! But there's nothing better than leaving our monkeys 
behind to go practice with the sand , swim a picture, or 
bake a/an hair . woah -- that's the bell! 
We nodding for after school!
